generations:
  - name: "First Generation (9PA)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2010
    description: "The first-generation Porsche Cayenne (9PA) represented Porsche's controversial but ultimately successful entry into the luxury SUV market. Developed in partnership with Volkswagen (which produced the related Touareg), the Cayenne maintained distinctive Porsche styling and driving characteristics despite its size and weight. Initially available with a 3.2-liter VR6 engine in the base model, a 4.5-liter V8 in the Cayenne S, and a twin-turbocharged version of the V8 producing 450 horsepower in the Turbo, the range later expanded to include the 520-horsepower Turbo S and more efficient V6 diesel and hybrid variants. The Cayenne featured permanent all-wheel drive with a low-range transfer case, offering genuine off-road capability alongside its on-road performance. The GTS variant, introduced in 2008, focused on sporty on-road dynamics with a lowered suspension and 405-horsepower naturally aspirated V8. The interior featured traditional Porsche design elements with a center-mounted tachometer and a button-heavy center console. Despite initial skepticism from Porsche purists, the Cayenne quickly became the brand's best-selling model, providing financial stability that enabled continued development of sports car models."

  - name: "Second Generation (92A)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The second-generation Cayenne (92A) refined the formula with sleeker styling, reduced weight, and improved efficiency while maintaining its predecessor's versatility. Though sharing its platform with the Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7, Porsche further differentiated the Cayenne with bespoke powertrains and tuning. Engine options included a 3.6-liter V6, 4.8-liter V8, twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 (in Turbo and Turbo S variants producing up to 570 horsepower), diesel V6 and V8 options, and a new S Hybrid model combining a supercharged V6 with an electric motor. This was later upgraded to a plug-in hybrid system in the S E-Hybrid. The transmission was standardized to an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic across the range. The interior was completely redesigned with influences from the Panamera, featuring higher quality materials and a more cohesive design. The center console incorporated many more physical buttons in a distinctive layout. The second-generation Cayenne introduced more advanced chassis systems, including Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) which utilized active anti-roll bars to reduce body roll. The GTS model continued as the driver-focused naturally aspirated V8 variant until the 2015 facelift, when it switched to a twin-turbocharged V6. The second-generation Cayenne expanded the model's appeal with improved dynamics and efficiency while maintaining its position as a uniquely sporting luxury SUV."

  - name: "Third Generation (9YA)"

    end_year: null
    description: "The third and current generation Cayenne (9YA) builds upon the success of its predecessors with evolutionary styling changes concealing a new platform shared with other Volkswagen Group luxury SUVs. Weight reduction was a key focus, with increased use of aluminum and a lighter, more rigid structure. The base model features a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 producing 335 horsepower, the S variant uses a 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 with 434 horsepower, and the GTS employs a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 making 453 horsepower. The Turbo variants extract up to 631 horsepower from the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 in the Turbo GT model. Hybrid options expanded with the E-Hybrid (455 horsepower) and Turbo S E-Hybrid (670 horsepower), both offering plug-in capability and extended electric range. All models utilize an 8-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. The exterior design features a wider, more horizontal emphasis with a continuous light strip across the rear. For the first time, the Cayenne is also available in a 'Coupe' body style featuring a more steeply raked roofline and unique rear styling. The interior has been thoroughly modernized with the Porsche Advanced Cockpit concept, reducing physical buttons in favor of touch-sensitive surfaces and larger digital displays. Chassis technology has advanced with options including rear-wheel steering, active anti-roll bars, and three-chamber air suspension. This generation further refines the Cayenne's balance of luxury, versatility, and performance that has made it a cornerstone of Porsche's lineup."

    description: "The fourth-generation Porsche Cayenne was officially unveiled on November 19, 2025, and will commence production in 2026. This generation marks a significant shift as it is exclusively available with a battery-electric powertrain as the Cayenne Electric, built on the Volkswagen Group Premium Platform Electric (PPE). The electric Cayenne features a 113 kWh battery pack (108 kWh net) with support for rapid charging at up to 400 kW. The dual-motor Turbo model produces over 804 horsepower (600 kW) with surge power capabilities reaching 938 horsepower (700 kW) and up to 1,072 horsepower (800 kW) with launch control. The interior has been modernized with a 14.25-inch OLED instrument display and a curved 12.25-inch OLED infotainment screen. Regenerative braking can reach 600 kW, supporting deceleration exceeding 0.5 Gs. While no fourth-generation internal combustion engine Cayenne has been confirmed, Porsche has announced another upgrade to the third-generation model that will extend its lifecycle beyond 2030."
